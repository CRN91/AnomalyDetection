# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

> Development is ongoing

This Python script generates a data stream of floating
point numbers representing real-time gas flow rates 
through pipeline interconnection points. It includes
functionality to insert anomalies into the data stream
and then separately detect them. Additionally, it provides
a real-time visualiser to display this information.
